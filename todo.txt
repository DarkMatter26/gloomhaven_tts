* = slated for next version

Content:
Cloudify assets from pigneedle, mapmaking, etc, and re-import
Componentize FAQ, put bits where they belong, remove from FAQ object
Fix map tiles that are reversed
Fully re-import & spoiler-minimize scenarios - 1 object per scenario, not per page (i.e. you don't see parts of the next scenario that happen to be printed on the same page in the book), & smaller file sizes too
Modify items that have errata, mark with a symbol to signify errata'd (e.g. euro? dagger?)
Reminder tokens for abilities, statuses, etc (eg shield, retaliate, jump)
Token background for 'immunity to X'


Layout
Improve layout of ItU setups


Scripting

Character & party saver / stager (like Sky Tools Stage, but for the non-board player content)
Element board: button to increment counter and decrement elements
Mat: char level requirement for item slots (max items = ceil(L/2)); kills; character sheet; battle goal; personal quest; summon minis; envelope; draw/shuffle modifier buttons; tap/untap items if present
Make maps side table work (hide & store objects while not in use)

End of Round button:
- element board
- shuffle monster abilities if pile has a shufflable
- shuffle modifiers if pile has a shufflable
- flip ID tokens back to number side
