The most complete Gloomhaven mod on TTS. Just load this and you're good to go.

All content is based on Gloomhaven's 2nd printing.


[h1]tl;dr?[/h1]

[i]Included:[/i]

[b]Everything[/b] in the box, and then some.

All in-box classes (including unlockables), with minis
All monsters & bosses, ditto
All main campaign, solo (including unlockables), No Pun Included (NPI), Into the Unknown, [i]and[/i] just-released Capital Intrigue scenarios
Most sealed content
Full rulebook, terrain, map, map stickers, achievements, etc etc.

Note: solo scenarios are stored inside the class enveleopes, to prevent spoilers.

[h1]How is this mod different from all other mods?[/h1]

This is a remix and customization of multiple other mods, content from BGG, and custom content.

The intent is to be a 100% complete Gloomhaven mod, focused on quality of life improvements to make the gameplay easier & faster, and making unlockable content unlock naturally (rather than being based on not reading parts of the page or cross-referencing lookup tables).

That end goal is a work in progress, but as is, it includes all available TTS Gloomhaven content - and then some. It's fully playable, and is already set up for starting your first campaign. Just create your characters, set up the first scenario, and go. :-)

[i]New, customized, and/or added content vs other mods[/i]

4-player Kraken table with two hands per player, extended & colored player tables, etc.
Character & monster envelopes that include minis, sleeves, etc.
Decoder card
Envelopes A, B, X & Deserve It
Gloomhaven visiting board with counting bowl of sanctuary donations
Monster trackers for regular / elite and # (v2 - not grid-snapping, for easier placement next to things)

Re-uploaded imgur etc content to Steam for faster & more reliable loading

Unlockable scenarios & other content separated from starting content
Various tweaks to make the stuff you need and help for it Just Work (and help prevent spoilers)
... and full integration of more or less all other TTS Gloomhaven mods' content.

Version update bags - for easier importing into an existing setup, pending creation of party save tool.
