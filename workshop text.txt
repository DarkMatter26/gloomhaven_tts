[h1]tl;dr?[/h1]

The most complete Gloomhave mod on TTS. Just load this and you're good to go.

All content is based on Gloomhaven's 2nd printing.

[i]Included[/i]

All in-box classes (including unlockables), with minis
All monsters & bosses, ditto
All main campaign, Into the Unknown, [i]and[/i] just-released Capital Intrigue scenarios
Most sealed content
Full rulebook, terrain, map, map stickers, achievements, etc etc.


[i]In the box but not yet included[/i]

The last envelope
Town Records book (contains story, not gameplay)
Some minor tokens & graphics that don't affect gameplay


[h1]How is this mod different from all other mods?[/h1]

This is a remix and customization of multiple other mods, content from BGG, and custom content.

The intent is to be a 100% complete Gloomhaven mod, focused on quality of life improvements to make the gameplay easier & faster, and making unlockable content unlock naturally (rather than being based on not reading parts of the page or cross-referencing lookup tables).

That end goal is a work in progress, but as is, it includes all available TTS Gloomhaven content - and then some. It's fully playable, and is already set up for starting your first campaign. Just create your characters, set up the first scenario, and go. :-)

[i]New, customized, and/or added content vs other mods[/i]

4-player Kraken table with two hands per player, extended & colored player tables, etc.
Character & monster envelopes that include minis, sleeves, etc.
Decoder card
Envelopes A, B & X
Gloomhaven visiting board with counting bowl of sanctuary donations
Monster trackers for Normal / Elite and #
Re-uploaded imgur etc content to Steam for faster & more reliable loading
Rule summaries & monster AI flowchart from BGG
Set of useful tools from across TTS
Stateful, infinite-bag map & terrain tiles
Stateful treasure index (to hide when not in use)
Stateful, locked containers for unlockable content & scenarios
Tri-color Bar Keep (red / blue / yellow) for HP bars, with wide variant option
Unlockable scenarios & other content separated from starting content
Various tweaks to make the stuff you need and help for it Just Work (and help prevent spoilers)
... and full integration of more or less all other TTS Gloomhaven mods' content.


[i]WIP (not yet included)[/i]

Character & party saver / stager (like Sky Tools Stage, but for the non-board player content)
Improved player mats (based on GabrielM's)
NPI scenario
Some post-printing
Solo scenarios
Spoiler-free nested scenarios & unlocks
Updating for post-printing errata

1. Deserve It contents (front & back)
